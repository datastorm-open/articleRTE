## A Tool Of Ptdf Manipulation In Order To Cluster And Visualize Domains

'Flow-based' is a methodology used in the CWE (Central Western Europe) area in order to compute exchange capacities offered by the electrical grid. For each time step, the set of possible exchanges is a n (usually 5)-dimensional  polyhedron called 'flow-based' domains. The purpose of this package is to import cluster and visualize 'flow-based' domains, manipulate the clusters and generate visualization reports of the clustering. (more information about 'flow-based' and the clustering methodology here: <https://antares-simulator.org/pages/documentation/9/>).
